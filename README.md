# 🎵 Spotify Song Recommendation System using Clustering

This project builds a *Spotify music recommendation system* by analyzing audio features and applying *unsupervised machine learning algorithms* like *K-Means* and *DBSCAN* to group songs based on similarity. Given a song, the system recommends similar songs from the same cluster.

---

## 📌 Features

- Recommends songs based on *audio feature similarity*
- Uses both *K-Means* and *DBSCAN* clustering algorithms
- Preprocessing with Z-score normalization
- Interactive visualizations using *Seaborn* and *Plotly*
- Built with *pandas, **numpy, **matplotlib, **scikit-learn*

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes metadata and audio features of thousands of Spotify tracks:
- track_name, artist_name, genre, popularity
- Audio features: danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, tempo, loudness
